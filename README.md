# Connecticut Green Bank Impact Analysis – Capstone Project

## Overview  
This project explores the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of investments made by the Connecticut Green Bank across the state of Connecticut. The Green Bank is a quasi-public agency that uses public capital to attract private investment in clean energy and environmental infrastructure. Using internal project datasets (safely de-identified for this course) and publicly available resources, this analysis aims to quantify how Green Bank activity relates to outcomes such as avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investment distribution across regions, energy burden reduction, and correlations with community characteristics.

## Research Goals  
The primary objectives of this capstone project include:

- Analyzing the geographic distribution of Green Bank–funded projects at the county and census tract levels.  
- Identifying relationships between project density, avoided GHG emissions, population demographics, and socioeconomic indicators.  
- Assessing whether regions with higher investment levels experience greater energy burden reductions or other measurable benefits.  
- Exploring potential correlations between project activity and single-family home values or community-level environmental indicators.  
- Using spatial data techniques to create maps, correlation visuals, and summaries that communicate real-world impact.

## Data Sources  
This project will incorporate:

- **Internal Green Bank project data** (e.g., project counts, investment amounts, avoided emissions)  
- **U.S. Census Bureau** demographic and socioeconomic data  
- **EPA EJScreen** environmental and equity indicators  
- **CT DEEP** emissions factors and energy datasets  

Only aggregated, non-sensitive datasets will be used for this academic project.

## Repository Structure  
This repository follows a simple but scalable structure to support analysis and reproducibility:
data/
    - raw_data/ - Original datasets (unchanged)
    - processed_data/ - Cleaned and prepared datasets
    - analysis/ - Additional analysis artifacts
    - metadata/ - Data dictionaries & documentation
    - outputs/ - Figures, tables, and final results
    - archive/ - Old or superseded files

scripts/
    README.txt # Notes on code organization


## Current Status  
This repository is in the early setup stage.  
Initial folder structures have been created, and starter scripts/notebooks will be added as the analysis begins. The next steps include loading project data, merging external datasets, and preparing the geospatial components for mapping and correlation work.
